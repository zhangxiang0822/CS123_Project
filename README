## Code Structure
All code processing results are put under "code" folder. They are listed below
  # Data Processing
  - data_preprocessing.py:  This is the code merging "nber data" with "nber_subcategory dataset" on Google Cloud
  - data preprocessing2.py: This is the code merging output of "data_preprocessing.py" to citation dataset
  - data_preprocessing_smalldata.py: This is the code preparing data for running Dijkstra algorithm on small data

  # Shortest Path
  - Dijkstra_smalldata.py:  This is the code implementing Dijkstra algorithm on small data set (using sample input data)
  - Dijkstra_parallel.py:   This is the code implementing Dijkstra algorithm (in fact, breadth-first search) on Google Cloud
